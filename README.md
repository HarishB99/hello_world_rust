# Creating a new Rust project manually

* No one in their right mind should be doing this.
* This project was created only to see if it is possible to
  change the default directory for Rust source code in
  `Cargo.toml`.
* Refer to `Cargo.toml` for the related configuration options
  (without the options specified, Cargo would have looked for
  `src/main.rs`
